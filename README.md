# pokemon_stuff

In engineering phase, laying groundwork for data science insights, battles are conducted by user inputting an enumerated move value

Pokemon is cool, hope y'all enjoy

Proposed next steps: 
  - write function to assign a damage values to moves 
  - scale HP to coordinate with the damage dealt by each move

If extra time allows: 
  - transition from Jupyter to shell-based script

Once proposed changed are synced and concise, we will merge changes to master and begin next iteration!
